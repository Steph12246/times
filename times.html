    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
      named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
      stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
      world of known physics.</p>
    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
      that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
      might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the
      presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
      special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
      swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
      look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
      enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
      Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
      like spit in the ocean.</p>
    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
      drew a double box around it.</p>
    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
      they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
      undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time
      with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M.
      Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
      in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature
      of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth
      of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
      smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
      that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
      including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
      comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
      apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
      space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
      billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is
      only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
      and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be
      an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
      pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
    <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>
    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating
      at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and
      yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
      first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
      Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert
      who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
    <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending
      a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
      microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
      universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,
      for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their
      results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on
      Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

    <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
    <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which
      explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the

    <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
      expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
    </p>
    <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,”
      said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

    <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
    </p>
    <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
      hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had
      been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of
      jubilation and caution.
    </p>
    <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if
      this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the
      history of science.”
    </p>
    <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report
      its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
      measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

    <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr.
      Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a
      special break point in the evolution of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
      asking about going any deeper into the past.
    </p>
    <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
      astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
